# Coffee_Machine
This project is about a coffee machine that offers 3 kinds of drinks. 

After a customer enters their order, the code will first check if the drink is on the menu. If the drink is indeed on the menu, the function will return the drink that we can then further work with. 
By using the drink we can check if the ingredients required are sufficient, if so, we will then proceed to the payment process, where a customer will insert coins. Once payment is successfully transacted, the machine will finish the order and ingredients will be reduced correspondingly. 

As an employee, you will have the access to the profit and ingredients available. You can also refill the machine to its fullest. 

p.s.
There are some minor inconveniences, such as ingredients being refilled unintentionally everytime we rerun the code / we can only take one drink at a time. In the future once I will refine the code to make the machine work as realistically as possible
